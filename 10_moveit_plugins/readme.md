## Overview

Moveit allow to extents 

- **Kinematic Plugin:** direct and inverse kinematic solvers.  
- **Planner Manager Plugin**: custon motion planners.
- **Planning Request Adapter Plugin:** They implement **planning request adapters**. Such kind of objects have two functionalities in MoviIte. Firstly, they are used to update/adjust a motion planning request before it passed to the solver. Secondly, they are used to manipulate the resulting motion plan as generated by the planner.
- **Controller Manager Plugin:** They are interfaces to custon ROS controls.
- **Controller Handle Allocator Pluging:** offer allocations of handlers for action based controllers.
- **Sensor Manager Pluging:** integrate sensores into the planning process.
- **Constraint Sampler Plugin:** Requres to implement a [sample](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/3361b2d1b6b2feabc2d3e93c75653f5a00e87fa4/moveit_core/constraint_samplers/include/moveit/constraint_samplers/constraint_sampler.h#L231) and [project](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/blob/3361b2d1b6b2feabc2d3e93c75653f5a00e87fa4/moveit_core/constraint_samplers/include/moveit/constraint_samplers/constraint_sampler.h#L245). `sample` should be capable of generated a random robot state on the manifold generated by the constraints. `project` should be capable of projecting a robot state into the manifold generated by the constraints.
- **Move Group Capability Pluging:** Not documentd.
- **Collision Detection Plugin:** implement custon collision detection systems.
- **Occupancy Map Updater Plugin:** Not documented.
